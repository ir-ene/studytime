# Study Time!

First game I'm currently creating using Unity. I'm not very familiar with C# or Unity, so this is a huge learning process for me!
About 50% complete and it's VERY buggy, just something I'm working on when I have free time.

## Description

Study Time! is a minimalist game/study tool set in a cute bedroom where you can:
* Set timers
* Create sticky notes
* Listen to lo-fi music with built-in music player
* Use hard-earned study sessions to redeem for cool furniture for your room
